      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>What is pipeChat?</h3>
      <p>pipeChat is a messaging website that allows you to send messages to other people through a <a target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ppng.io/">piping server</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
      <p>Just go to <a href="chat.html">pipeChat</a>, make up an ID for yourself, enter the ID of someone you want to
        message, and click connect!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>When you send a message, pipeChat sends it through a link on the piping server determined by your ID and the ID
        of the person you're trying to message. When recieving a message, your client looks at the link where the person
        you're linked with sends messages to. When it notices a message on the link, it sends the message to you.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Are my messages secure?</h3>
      <p>pipeChat is one of the most secure messaging websites available. Piping server has built in end to end
        encryption, and uses HTTPS to ensure that your messages cannot be traced. Even if a hacker was able to guess the
        two IDs, blocks connections from third parties are automatically blocked.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>I started using pipeChat normally, or I reloaded the page, and suddenly a bunch of messages saying "[ERROR] The
        number of receivers has reached limits." appeared!</h3>
      <p>Sometimes this happens when you reload the page and use the same local or other ID, as the piping server thinks
        that the new reloaded tab is a thrid party trying to view messages. However, it can happen completely randomly for
        no reason as well. To fix it, just wait a few seconds and reload the tab again. If that doesn't work, simply use a
        new ID.</p>
      <br>
